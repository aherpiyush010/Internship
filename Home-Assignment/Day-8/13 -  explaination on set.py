# 13.	Explain (in comments or writing):
# â€¢	When to use a tuple over a list or set
# â€¢	When to use a set over a list or tuple

# ðŸ”¹ When to use a TUPLE over a LIST or SET:

# â€¢ Use a tuple when your data should NOT change (i.e., it's immutable).
# â€¢ Tuples are ideal for fixed collections like coordinates (x, y), RGB colors, or database records.
# â€¢ Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable (unlike lists and sets).
# â€¢ Tuples preserve order and allow duplicate values.
# â€¢ Use a tuple when you want a lightweight, fixed-size container.


# ðŸ”¹ When to use a SET over a LIST or TUPLE:

# â€¢ Use a set when you need to store UNIQUE elements only.
# â€¢ Sets are unordered and do not allow duplicates.
# â€¢ Sets are useful for fast membership testing (checking if an item exists).
# â€¢ Sets are good for mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.
# â€¢ Sets are more efficient than lists for removing duplicates.
