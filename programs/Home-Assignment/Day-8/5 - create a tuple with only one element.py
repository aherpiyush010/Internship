# 5.	Create a tuple with one item only:
# Example: t = ("Python",)
# (Why is the comma necessary?)

#  create a single-item tuple
t = ("Python",)

print(type(t))   
print(t)         

# In Python, parentheses () are used for grouping and not just for creating tuples.

# The comma is what actually tells Python: "This is a tuple."
